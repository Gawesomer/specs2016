# specs2016 Documentation
The *specs2016* project is a re-writing of the *specs* pipeline stage from CMS, only changed quite a bit.

*specs* is a command line utility for parsing and re-arranging text input. It allows re-alignment of fields, some format conversion, plus quite a bit of computation and re-formatting multiple lines into single lines or vice versa. Input comes from standard input or files, and output flows to standard output or files.

This version is liberally based on the [**CMS Pipelines User's Guide and Reference**](https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/epubs/pdf/hcsj0c30.pdf), especially chapters 16, 24, and 20.
