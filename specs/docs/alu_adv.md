# Advanced ALU

Very much a draft

## Table of Operands

| Op | Name | Meaning |
| -- | ---- | ------- |
| `+` | Unary Plus | |
| `-` | Unary Minus | Negates its operand, so if `a` is 5.3 then `-a` is -5.3 |
| `!` | Unary Not | Logical Not. If the result is zero, returns `1`, otherwise returns zero |
| `+` | Binary Plus | returns the addition of its two operands |
