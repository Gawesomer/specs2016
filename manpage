.SH NAME
specs \- a text processing tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
specs [switches] spec-units
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B specs
is a command line utility for parsing and re-arranging text input. It allows re-alignment of fields, some format conversion, and re-formatting multiple lines into single lines or vice versa. Input comes from standard input, and output flows to standard output.
.P 
This is a re-writing of the specs pipeline stage from CMS, only changed quite a bit.
.P 
This version is liberally based on the CMS Pipelines User's Guide and Reference
.URL "https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/epubs/pdf/hcsj0c30.pdf"
-- especially chapters 16, 24, and 20.

.SS "Spec Units"
The most common spec unit is a 
.I data field
which consists of five arguments, three of which may be omitted:
.P
.RS 5
[fieldIdentifier] InputPart [conversion] OutputPart [alignment]
.RE
.P

The 
.B InputPart
argument may be any of the following:
.RS 3
.P
A range of characters, such as `5`, `3-7`, or `5.8`, the last one indicating 8 characters starting in the 5th position. Note that the indexing of characters is 1- rather than 0-based.
.P
A range of words, such as `w5` or `words 5-7`, where words are separated by one or more `wordseparator` characters -- spaces by default. The word indexing is 1-based.
.P
A range of fields, such as `fields 5` or `f5-7`, where fields are separated by exactly one `fieldseparator` characters -- a tab by default. The field indexing is 1-based.
.P 
.B TODclock
-- A 64-bit formatted timestamp, giving microseconds since the Unix epoch.
.P 
.B DTODclock
-- A 64-bit formatted timestamp, giving microseconds since the Unix epoch. The difference is that TODclock shows the time when this run of
.I specs
begun, while DTODclock gives the time of producing the current record.
.P
.B NUMBER
-- A record counter as a 10-digit decimal number.
.P
.B TIMEDIFF
-- An 8-digit decimal number indicating the number of seconds since the invocation of the program.
.P
The 
.B ID
keyword followed by a previously defined 
.B FieldIdentifier.
.P
The 
.B PRINT
keyword followed by a calculated expression
.P
A string literal, optionally enclosed by delimiters, such as `/TODclock/` or `'NUMBER'`. Note that to include the single quotes on the command line requires you to enclose them in double quotes.
.P
A 
.B SUBSTring
of another InputPart.
.RE
    
The 
.B OutputPart
argument specifies where to put the source:
.RS 3
.P
Absolute position (such as `1`) with no limit on output length.
.P
A range (such as `1-5` or `1.5`)
.P
.B N 
or
.B NEXT
for placing the output immediately after the previous output.
.P
.B NW 
or
.B NEXTWORD
for placing the output following a space character after the previous output.
.P
.B NF
or
.B NEXTFIELD
for placing the output following a tab character after the previous output.
.P 
A field identifier specification such as 
.B a:
or
.B C:
\&.
.RE
    
The alignment argument can be `l`, `c`, or `r`, for
.B left
,
.B center
, and
.B right
respectively. Yes, you can use the entire word. In fact, for compatibility with other countries, you can even spell it
.B centre.

The conversion argument can specify any of the following conversions:
.IP "rot13" 3
Encrypts the bytes using the ROT-13 cipher
.IP "C2B" 3
Converts characters to binary: "AB" --> "0010000100100010"
.IP "C2X" 3
Converts characters to hexadecimal: "AB" --> "4142"
.IP "B2C" 3
Converts binary to characters: "0010000100100010" --> "AB". Will throw an exception if called with an invalid character.
.IP "X2CH" 3
Converts hexadecimal to characters: "4142" --> "AB". Will throw an exception if called with an invalid character.
.IP "b2x" 3
Converts binary data to hex
.IP "D2X" 3
Convert decimal to hex: "314159265" --> "12b9b0a1"  (not working yet)
.IP "X2D" 3
Convert hex to decimal: "12b9b0a1" --> "314159265"  (not working yet)
.IP "ucase" 3
Converts text to uppercase (not working yet)
.IP "lcase" 3
Converts text to lowercase (not working yet)
.IP "BSWAP" 3
Byte Swap. reverses the order of bytes. "AB" --> "BA"
.IP "ti2f" 3
Convert internal time format (8-byte microseconds since the epoch) to printable format using the conventions of strftime, plus %xf for fractional seconds, where x represents number of digits from 0 to 6.
.IP "tf2i" 3
Convert printable time format to the internal 8-byte representation. 

.SS "Other Spec Units"
There are also other spec units, that may be used:
.IP "READ" 3
Causes the program to read the next line of input. If we have already read the last line, the read line is taken to be the empty string.
.IP "READSTOP" 3
Causes the program to read the next line of input. If we have already read the last line, no more processing is done for this iteration.
.IP "WRITE" 3
Causes the program to write to output and reset the output line.
.IP "WORDSEPARATOR and FIELDSEPARATOR" 3
Declare a character to be the word of field separator respectively, which affects word and field ranges.
.IP "REDO" 3
Causes the current output line to become the new input line.  NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.
.IP "SET" 3
Followed by an assignment operation, SET implements this and assigns a value to one of the system counters. See the Expressions and Assignments section.

.SS "Expressions and Assignments"
Expressions are used in PRINT data units as well as in assignments. Assignments are used in SET Spec Units.

Expressions are made up of numbers, field identifiers (no colon needed), and counter numbers preceded by a hash mark. They allow ordinary arithmetic and logical operations as well as function calls for pre-defined functions:
.IP "Unary Operators" 3
+ (plus - does nothing), - (minus), ! (logical NOT)
.IP "Binary Arithmetic Operators" 3
+, -, *. / (division), // (integer division), % (remainder)
.IP "Binary String Operator" 3
|| (string append)
.IP "Binary Arithmetic/String Logical Operators" 3
<, >, <=, >=, =, !=
.IP "Binary Strict Logical Operators" 3
<<, >>, <<=, >>=, ==. !==
.IP "Binary Logical Operators" 3
& (AND), | (OR)

.P 
Assignments assign the result of an expression into a numbered counter. For example:

	#3 := b+3
	
.IP "Assignment Operators" 3
:=, +=, -=, *=, /=, //=, %=, ||=

.SS "Built-In Functions"
.IP "abs(x)" 3
The absolute function returns the absolute value of the number passed to it. Will return an integer if the parameter is integer, or float otherwise.
.IP "pow(x,y)" 3
The power function returns x to the power of y. Much like arithmetic operations, if either operand is float, the result is a float. If both operands are integers, the result is an integer. Otherwise, if both operands are whole numbers, the result is integer, otherwise it is float.
.IP "sqrt(x)" 3
The square root function always returns a float.

.P
NOTE: This list is going to be expanded greatly in a future version.

.SH OPTIONS
specs supports the following switches:
.IP "--toASCII" 3
Causes output to be translated into ASCII if it's outside the range.
.IP "--force-read-input" 3
Forces specs to read every input line even if none of the spec units use it. By default it won't.
.IP "--specFile or -f" 3
Makes the program read the specification from a file rather than the command line. This is useful both for reusing specifications and for long specifications. It also relieves the plumber from having to escape a lot of characters in the specification to avoid creative interpretation by the Unix shell.
.IP "--verbose or -v" 3
Outputs more information when something goes wrong.
.IP "--stats"
Output statistics on run time, and records read, and on records written.

.SH EXAMPLES
`ls -l` yields this:

    -rw-r--r--@ 1 ynir  admin   1547 Nov 23 00:10 specs.h

Let's run it though a spec:

    ls -l | specs 12-* 1 redo w2 1 w4 d2x 8.8 r w8 17
    
The first spec unit converts it to this:

    1 ynir  admin    574 Aug 25  2009 Makefile
    1 ynir  admin   3542 Nov 23 00:21 README
    1 ynir  admin    362 Nov 19 08:31 conversion.h
    1 ynir  admin    984 Nov 11 17:45 ls.txt
    1 ynir  admin   2233 Nov 23 00:03 main.cc
    1 ynir  admin   9412 Nov 23 00:11 main.o
    1 ynir  admin   6567 Nov 23 00:09 spec_build.cc
    1 ynir  admin  16776 Nov 23 00:11 spec_build.o
    1 ynir  admin   5494 Nov 19 08:30 spec_convert.cc
    1 ynir  admin  17004 Nov 23 00:11 spec_convert.o
    1 ynir  admin  11419 Nov 23 00:10 spec_params.cc
    1 ynir  admin  21080 Nov 23 00:11 spec_params.o
    1 ynir  admin    375 Nov 11 09:29 spec_vars.cc
    1 ynir  admin   4800 Nov 23 00:11 spec_vars.o
    1 ynir  admin  36740 Nov 23 00:11 specs
    1 ynir  admin   1547 Nov 23 00:10 specs.h

Then after the redo, we get this:

    ynir        23e Makefile
    ynir        dd6 README
    ynir        16a conversion.h
    ynir        3d8 ls.txt
    ynir        8b9 main.cc
    ynir       24c4 main.o
    ynir       19a7 spec_build.cc
    ynir       4188 spec_build.o
    ynir       1576 spec_convert.cc
    ynir       426c spec_convert.o
    ynir       2c9b spec_params.cc
    ynir       5258 spec_params.o
    ynir        eae spec_vars.cc
    ynir       12c0 spec_vars.o
    ynir       8f84 specs
    ynir        60b specs.h

      
Alternatively, let's arrange this on multiple lines:

    ls -l | specs w9 1 write "Owner:" 3 w3 10 write "Size:" 3 w5 10-20 r

    Makefile
      Owner: ynir
      Size:          574
    README
      Owner: ynir
      Size:         5834
    conversion.h
      Owner: ynir
      Size:          362
    list.txt
      Owner: ynir
      Size:          978
    ls.txt
      Owner: ynir
      Size:          984
    main.cc
      Owner: ynir
      Size:         2233
    main.o
      Owner: ynir
      Size:         9412

Finally, let's make our own version of the multi-column display:

    ls -l | specs w9 1 read w9 26 read w9 51
                             Makefile                 README
    conversion.h             main.cc                  main.o
    spec_build.cc            spec_build.o             spec_convert.cc
    spec_convert.o           spec_params.cc           spec_params.o
    spec_vars.cc             spec_vars.o              specs
    specs.h
